## Business Case
At Ontario Tech University, course content is revised frequently to adapt to changes in the industry. To help maintain a common understanding of the course content between university staff, as well as facilitate the distribution of content to students, it is advised to implement a course management system (CMS) that stores, provides, and represents static and dynamic course information. Some key functionalities of the system are presented below:

- Users can create accounts to log into the system
- Users can message other users
- Staff can create, delete, edit, and view courses/course information
- Staff can manage student grades
- Staff can subscribe/unsubscribe students from courses
- Students can subscribe/unsubscribe from courses
- Students can view course information
- Students can upload submissions
- Students can create teams to collaborate

Four different parties will interact with the system, namely students, lecturers, administration, and maintainers. "Staff" refers to lecturers and administration.

Implementing this system provides administration, lecturers and students a common location to reference for course material, and allows university staff to manage course content and enrolled students in an organized fashion. The system also allows communication between users via its messaging function, providing a real-time, less formal alternative to email.
